# Autocomplete.java is a program that helps the user to complete their search by showing them all of the results as they type. I built three instance of autocomplete object to do the searching and comparing to find out all the possible results. They are BinarySearchAutocomplete.java, TreeSetAutocomplete.java, TernarySearchTreeAutocomplete.java where each using a different data structure to store all of the strings. Run SimpleExample.java, it finds all the words starts with the prefix "do", for more complex example, please run "Cities.java" which contains a dataset of all cities name.
